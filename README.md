## Kaggle Restaurant EDA Learning Process

This repository is to hold my process of converting a KAggle user's notebook which was written in R using ggplot for the plots, into Python using plotly and later on matplotlib as a personal learning process.

The Kaggle notebook being referenced can be found here: [Kaggle Notebook by Heads or Tails](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/be-my-guest-recruit-restaurant-eda/report)
